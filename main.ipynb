       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nâ€¦\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between usâ€”however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendshipâ€”exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our heartsâ€”for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Scaled Dot-Product Attention is from the context provided. Let me go through the information step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I see that it's called \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" and they mention using a compatibility function for each query and key. The weight assigned to each value is divided by the square root of dk, where dk is the dimension of the queries and keys. Then, after computing the dot products, they apply a softmax function to get the weights on the values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so in more detail: when a query vector Q and a key vector K are multiplied together (their dot product), that's one part. But then you scale each component by 1/sqrt(dk). After that, the entire set of these scaled values is passed through a softmax function to get attention weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not exactly sure how this compares to other attention mechanisms like multiplicative attention or others. The text also mentions that each value becomes a scaled version of the dot product result divided by sqrt(dk), which probably adjusts the magnitude so that the sum remains manageable, hence the need for scaling and then the softmax normalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I get the main points: scaling is done to prevent the attention values from becoming too large, and then we normalize them with the softmax function to compute the output vectors. That makes sense because in standard attention mechanisms without scaling, if Q is much larger than K, the dot products could be really big numbers that make the attention weights too concentrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, Scaled Dot-Product Attention involves taking each element of the query vector multiplied by a key vector (the dot product), scaling them down with 1/sqrt(dk), and then using these scaled values to compute attention across different dimensions. This should be simpler than multiplicative attention and probably works as well or better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also curious about how this affects training costs, especially since it's mentioned that the training cost was around 23 FLOPs for a certain setup. But maybe I don't need to get into the weeds here; just understanding the mechanism is enough.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) is an attention mechanism where each query vector is multiplied by a key vector, resulting in dot products. These values are scaled by dividing them by the square root of the dimension of the vectors (sqrt(dk)), preventing excessively large numbers and ensuring normalization through a softmax function. This approach effectively normalizes the attention weights, making it simpler than multiplicative attention while retaining comparable performance.\n",

      "**Answer:**\n",
      "Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) involves computing dot products between query and key vectors, scaling each by 1/sqrt(dk), followed by applying a softmax to get attention weights.
